# ff-dashboard
Building a fantasy football dashboard for Sleeper leagues.

This code will scrape your league's info, merge it with DynastyProcess asset values, and upload to a specified Google Sheet for lightweight dashboarding.

How to use:
- Update the constants file to match your personal league, Google Sheets email, and other league settings.
- Run `dashboard_uploader.R` (this can also be scheduled as a cronjob)
